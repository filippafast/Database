### 🇸🇪 Webbutveckling inom .NET - Datalagring | Project by Filippa Fast

#### ℹ️ *This project involves building an issue management system where users can submit error reports for various issues and update the status of these issues.<br> 📌 Important emphasis - The main purpose of the project is functionality, not design. 📌 <br>The database is stored in Microsoft SQL Server. The database uses tables that are normalized to the 1st to 3rd Normal Form (NF). In the application, it is possible to create an issue/error report, which is saved in the storage solution. When an issue is registered, the following information is saved: the customer's first and last name, email address, phone number, description of the issue, the time when the issue was created, and the status of the issue.* ℹ️
